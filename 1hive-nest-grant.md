## Notes and Stuff

Recently crypto-twitter has been quite excited about Moloch DAO. It also appears to be gaining some traction as large whales including Joe Lubin and Vitalik has requested membership. They have also recently been forked by MetaCartel. It seems like it would be both fairly trivial and also quite useful to have a similar suite of functionality available to Aragon organizations.

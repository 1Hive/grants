<p align='center'>Determining the initial goals/scope for 1Hive and applying to grants that could support that</p>

<br>

## [Issues](https://github.com/1Hive/grants/issues)

This will be where we discuss and curate projects we want to work on.
- yes = something we want to request grants for
- maybe = something we're might want to requests grants for
- no = something we're not going to request grants for
- under development = something we're actively developing

Note: this is a repo to focus our initiatives around grants funding, so even if we're working on something that doesn't mean that it's ready to be included in a grant app. Rejecting ideas in this repo does not mean rejecting them as a whole.

## Potential Grants

This is where we can keep a rolling list of grants programs that could support 1Hive.

- [Aragon Nest Grants](https://github.com/aragon/nest) - A grants program to support the development of the Aragon ecosystem.
- [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/) - Gitcoin Grants, powered by the EIP 1337 standard , are a fast, easy and secure way to provide recurring token contributions to your favorite OSS maintainers. 
- [Lemonade Stand](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand) - A list of funding options for open source projects and communities.
- There's also some more stuff [here](https://github.com/1Hive/ideas/issues/4).

## Docs in the repo

This is where we can draft grant proposals talking about the projects we're woking on and why we think we should get money to work on them.
